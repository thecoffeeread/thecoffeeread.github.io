Legend has it that a person called Majzoob who was considered to be a mad man , stayed beside the Fateh Darwaza and secured it. At the point when Aurangazab was prepared to overcome the Fort, the presence of this person never permitted them to invade the passage. Only when another officer in the Mughal armed force made him move from that point, was Aurangazed able to attack the fort.

A clap at a fixed place at the entrance can be heard clearly at the ‘Bala Hissar’ pavilion, the highest point almost a kilometre away. This served two purposes – if an intruder got in , it served as a warning . Secondly, it also served as a way for the royals to know they had guests. The Golkonda fort ifs full of such architectural and acoustic marvels. Even whispers at some corners of the halls can be heard distinctly in the other corner.

Golconda , or “Golla Konda” , literally meaning Shepherd’s hill, was originally built in the thirteenth century by the then Kakatiya rulers. A shephard boy originally came across an idol on the hill, which led to the then rulers constructing a mud fort. The fort had expanded around the mud fort.
