Haleem is a Hyderabadi specialty so good that hardcore foodies make the pilgrimage to Hyderabad just to savour its rich flavours. The origin of haleem lies in the popular Arabian dish known as harisah.

###### WE ALL LOVE HALEEM , ESPECIALLY DURING THE MONTH OF RAMZAN. HERE IS A LIST OF THE BEST HALEEM PLACES IN HYDERABAD TO KEEP YOUR TASTE BUDS GOING!

## **1.SHAH GHOUSE CAFE:**

**Where:** Opposite SA Imperial Gardens, Near RTA Office, Tolichowki, Hyderabad

**Why :** This place is one of the most iconic venues , not just for Haleem , but anything Hyderabad has to offer in terms of food. It gets pretty crowded at given time , so prepare to wait it out.

## **2. SHADAB HOTEL:  
**

**Where : **Though he has an exclusive takeaway joint at Banjara hills, I am still a fan of the one at High Court road.

**Why:** He serves one of the best Haleem the city has to offer. With a price that goes easy on the pocket, this place is value for money!

## **3. PARADISE:**

[image source](https://www.google.co.in/search?biw=1350&bih=568&tbs=isz%3Alt%2Cislt%3Axga&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=YAbsWqutJ4OR8wWSvrwI&q=paradise+secunderabad&oq=paradise+sec&gs_l=psy-ab.3.1.0l5j0i5i30k1l2j0i8i30k1l3.29729.30331.0.32237.3.3.0.0.0.0.177.520.0j3.3.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.3.520....0.vo-ygGh08f8#imgrc=28VsqXR77MYu0M:)

**Where :** It helps the fact that Paradise itself is known as a landmark . Located at Secunderabad.

**Why :** One of the most iconic restaurants ever, this joint has now opened multiple outlets throughout the city. That being said, I am still a fan of the original one at Secunderabad. Of late , he has been catering to larger crowds, which has made the haleem milder and richer. Not something an authentic Hyderabadi would like. But if you cannot handle the spice of the original haleem , this is the place to go to !

## **4. CAFE BAHAR:  
**

**Where :** Old MLA quarters, Basheerbagh

**Why : **Cafe Bahar is one of my personal favourites. With a haleem that is rich and spicy at the same time , this place reeks of good food and cheap prices. The ambience might not be what you were looking for , but the food more than compensates for it. He did open up another branch at Begumpet though. Do give that a try!

## **5. PISTA HOUSE:  
** 

![Image result for pista house haleem](http://www.forevernews.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Pista-House.jpg) 

[image source](https://www.google.co.in/search?biw=1350&bih=568&tbs=isz%3Alt%2Cislt%3Axga&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=agXsWq1DxOzwBbGjj_gC&q=pista+house+haleem&oq=pista+haleem&gs_l=psy-ab.3.1.0j0i7i30k1l2j0i8i30k1l2j0i24k1.40704.43727.0.45160.10.9.1.0.0.0.304.1108.0j5j0j1.6.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..4.6.956...0i13k1j0i8i13i30k1j0i8i7i30k1.0.u-sm35V9UlE#imgrc=A2pvjcARJfyICM:)

**Where :** It’s hard to point out which Pista house outlet to go to , considering he opens up one for every colony, come Ramzan. But I prefer the one at Nampally for some reason.  
**Why: **Pista House is one of the largest Haleem manufacturers in the city. While his haleem is not that spicy , I really like the quality of the meat that he uses. Also , he has the distinction of being one of the very few brands in the world that export haleem. And yes, all those handis are for a single outlet in the picture below.

##  6. SARVI RESTAURANT:

![Image result for sarvi restaurant haleem](https://www.shoppirate.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Sarvi-1.jpeg)

**Where :** Banjara Hills

**Why : **Having stayed around Banjara Hills for a while, Sarvi was the guy I used to rely on for my haleem. Located conveniently, good food, nice seating arrangement and decent quantities. All in all , a perfect fit!

## **7.Y2K RESTAURANT:**

**Where:** Panjagutta, next to the police station.

**Why :  **One of the best haleem in the city. Most importantly, this guy is up way in the night for any food cravings that you might have. The haleem here is to die for, and is just how I like it. Add in a bit of lemon juice to that , and you are good to go!

#### **8.CAFE 555 **

**Where :** Masab Tank

**Why : **While some people might find Cafe 555’s haleem bland, the Cafe commands it’s own loyal set of followers. With haleem that is served piping hot AND decent parking space, this place continues to have it’s loyal set of visitors.**

Where : Opposite Sandhya Theatre, RTC X Roads .

Why : Not to be confused with Green Bawarchi , New Bawarchi , Golden Bawarchi , Best Bawarchi or Grand Bawarchi. This place is as old as time and serves haleem that is simply amazing.
