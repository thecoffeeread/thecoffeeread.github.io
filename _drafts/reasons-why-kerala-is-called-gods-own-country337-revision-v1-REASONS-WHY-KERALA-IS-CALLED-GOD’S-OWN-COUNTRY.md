According to Hindu mythology, Kerala was created by Lord Parasurama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu by throwing his axe across the sea to create new land for his devotees to live peacefully. So, Kereala is God&#8217;s own creation, hence it is called God&#8217;s own country.

The National Geographic’s Traveller magazine names Kerala as one among the “10 paradises on the world” and “50 must-see destinations of a lifetime”. Over the years Kerala has made the catchy slogan “God’s own Country”, every bit its own and its not hard to see why.

Kerala’s lush evergreen glow is characteristic of its unique geography. Nestled in the midst of the Arabian sea on one side and majestic western ghats on the other, Kerala fetches itself the rich gift of the monsoon showers thus becoming an emerald beauty adorned by never ending stretches of coconut palms and sprawling paddy fields. Kerala’s wondrous destinations are uniquely spaced so close to each other that one can be atop a hill station by noon, and at a beach for the sunset.

## 2. THE CLIMATE:
