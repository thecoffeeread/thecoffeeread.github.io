Engineering colleges. The first things which come to  mind are their accreditation, reputation and placements. That is every-ones primary focus. The campus is also an important aspect. The campus is a place where one spends 4 years of their life, bunking classes, going on long walks with their special someones and especially to take the occasional DSLR photo-shoot. Here are a few campuses with such profound beauty.
