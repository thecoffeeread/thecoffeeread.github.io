Nostalgia hits hard when we see kids playing around, running for the ball, it makes us want to play again. But today, it has become really hard to find kids playing. Addiction to gadgets is robbing children of their childhood, making their childhood unmemorable.

Here are few things only 90&#8217;s kids would understand:

## 1.STREET CRICKET

Street cricket was our kind of playstation, making up weird rules of the game, making it more interesting, making it more fun.

Riding the bicycle in empty streets, with a group of friends is still one of the best memories for 90&#8217;s kids. Having bicycle was a privilege for 90&#8217;s kids.
