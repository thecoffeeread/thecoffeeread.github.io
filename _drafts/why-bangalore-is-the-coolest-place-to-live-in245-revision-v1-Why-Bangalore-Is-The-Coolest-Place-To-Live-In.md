excerpt: |
  Once called the "Garden City of India" and the "Pensioner's Paradise", these epithets no longer apply to Bangalore, which is now a large, cosmopolitan city with diminishing green spaces and a large working population. Bangalore is the major center of India's IT industry, popularly known as the Silicon Valley of India.

The population of local Kannadigas in Bangalore is less than 41%. Hence a true cosmopolitan with around 25% Tamilians, 14% Telugites, 10% Keralites, 8% Europeans, and 6% a mixture of all races. You thought More of Kannad-ish didn’t you..!!

## 2. ENGINEERS AND IT COMPANIES:

Bangalore has highest percentage of engineers in the world, with more than a million IT professionals making the city their home.

Your chances are high when you are at this place.

The word **Bangalored **is often used in USA and was added to English language. This means the job was outsourced to Bangalore, India.

## 3. LAKES AND LAKES EVERYWHERE:

With more than 200 lakes and tanks, Bangalore could boast of highest number of lakes earlier, but most of them are untraceable due to land encroachment and they turned into Golf courses and Clubs.

## 4. GARDEN CITY OF INDIA IS A KNOWN FACT:
