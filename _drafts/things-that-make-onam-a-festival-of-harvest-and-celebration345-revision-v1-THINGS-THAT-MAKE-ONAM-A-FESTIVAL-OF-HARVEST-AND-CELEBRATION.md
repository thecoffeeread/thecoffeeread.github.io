According to folklore, Mahabali was a very kind and generous king who looked after his people well. Lord Vishnu, disguised himself as Vamana and asked him for 3 steps of land, to which the good king obliged. Vamana grew into cosmic proportions and in two steps covered the earth and the skies. The brahmin then placed the 3rd step on the king’s head, pusjing him into the nether world (patala). Legend has it that king Mahabali visited his subject every year since, on Onam.
