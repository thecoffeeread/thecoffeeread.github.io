In 1817 a Plague disease broke out in Twin Cities of Hyderabad & Secunderabad taking thousands of lives. Earlier the dieties of Hindu gods were abolished by Muslim rulers. The locals prayed to the Mother Goddess in Mahankaal Temple of Ujjain saying that if people were saved from the epidemic they would install the idol of Mahankali back in their city.

The plague was eventually gone and It is believed by the devotees that goddess Durga/Mahankaali destroyed the disease. The Hindu deities were installed back in the temples and people started celebrating the festival every year since that year.

## 9. THE INTENTION BEHIND THE CELEBRATION.

It is believed that the Goddess comes back to her maternal home during Ashada Maasam, so people come to see her and bring offerings of food to show their love and affection, just as they would prepare a special meal when their own daughters visit them.
