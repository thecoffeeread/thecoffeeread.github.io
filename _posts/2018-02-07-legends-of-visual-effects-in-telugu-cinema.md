It’s great to see visual effects and computer graphics imagery in the films that have come far away in Telugu Cinema. Not to forget the legends who have brought the Telugu cinema this far and paved a way to it’s future. The Telugu Cinema can proudly claim that it’s own visual effects have had a strong impression in the Indian Film Industry.

The 3-time National award-winning writer and director has proved it in his works – ‘Pathala Bhairavi‘ and ‘ Maya Bazaar‘. Inspired by Kasi Majili Kathalu and Aladdin, Pathala Bhairavi was his first tryst with the visual effects. Very smoothly integrated into the story, struggle of Thota Ramudu and Nepala Mantrikudu. The movie was coupled by the legendary performance of SV Rangarao and NT Rama Rao with the visual effects rendered into a classic.

6 years later, KV Reddy made the magnum opus bilingual ‘MayaBazaar‘. Inspired by Sasirekha Parinayam from Mahabharata, the film showcased an amazing slice of Mahabharata with splendid camerawork, spell bounding visual effects and fascinating trick photography. The scenes involving SV Rangarao as Ghatothkachudu in the latter half of the movie which includes the famous Vivaha Bhojanambu are pure gold. KV Reddy garu was known for his collaborations with the Anglo Indian cinematographer Marcus Bartley. His other films like Sri Krishnarjuna Yuddham and Sri Krishna Satya also had some visual effects. It’s true when they say – ‘It all started with KV Reddy garu’s imagination’.

## 2. B. VITTALACHARYA.:

SS Rajamouli used computer graphics for an action sequence back in 2005 in **Chatrapathi**.
