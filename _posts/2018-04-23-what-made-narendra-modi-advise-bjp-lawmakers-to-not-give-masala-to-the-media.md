The Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been criticised heavily in the past few weeks for his silence on the Kathua rape case, has now cautioned the MPs and MLAs of his party, the BJP, against making needless remarks. Saying that these remarks give the media unnecessary masala to damage the party&#8217;s image, he posted a video on the Narendra Modi app, and said &#8220;It may sound bitter, but it is important for me to say this to you. Sometimes our workers criticise media, but we have to think if we committed mistakes and gave masala to the media.&#8221;

## Narendra Modi Interacting With Lawmakers:



Of late, several BJP politicians have been shooting of ridiculous statements and with crucial state elections around the corner, it has become a matter of embarrassment for the ruling party. Here&#8217;s a look of who said what in the recent times.

## Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb:

The Tripura CM Biplab Kumar Deb was at the receiving end of a lot of potshots when he said India had internet during the Mahabharata times. “This is the country where the episodes of the Mahabharat war were narrated to Dhritarashtra by Sanjay,” he reportedly said at an event in Agartala. “This means technology was there, Internet was there, satellite was there&#8230;”

## Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan:

Speaking on account of Stephen Hawking&#8217;s death, the Union Science and technology minister Harsh Vardhan controversially claimed that British scientist, who died last month, had said the Vedas might have a theory superior to Albert Einstein’s equation, E=mc2.

## Union Education Minister Satyapal Singh:

The Union Education Minister Satyapal Singh had shot one of the most ridiculous statements in January when he said that Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution of man was “scientifically wrong” and it needs to be changed in school and college curriculum. He was quoted saying “Darwin’s theory (of evolution of humans) is scientifically wrong. It needs to change in school and college curriculum. Since the man is seen on Earth he has always been a man.”

## Union Minister Santosh Gangwar:

In response to the outrage over the Kathua rape case, Union Minister Santosh Gangwar said in a country as big as India people should not make an issue out of one or two rape incidents.
