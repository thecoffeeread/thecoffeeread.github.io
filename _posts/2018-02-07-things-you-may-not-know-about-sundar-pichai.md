The internet has gone bonkers with the news that Google is now a part of Alphabet, a conglomerate of companies that have a very diverse portfolio. One of their major changes has been the appointment of Sundar Pichai as the new CEO of Google. Here are ten things that you probably did not know about him :

#### 1. HE IS A PROUD ALUMNUS OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, KHARAGPUR. HE GRADUATED WITH A  DEGREE IN METALLURGICAL ENGINEERING. ACCORDING TO ONE OF HIS TUTORS, AS QUOTED BY THE TIMES OF INDIA, HE WAS THE “BRIGHTEST IN HIS BATCH”:

#### 2. HIS FAMILY DID NOT POSSESS A PHONE UNTIL HE WAS TWELVE. AND NOW, HE HEADS THE ANDROID DIVISION AMONG OTHER DIVISIONS IN GOOGLE. THAT IS ONE HELL OF A TRANSFORMATION:
